              <p>
                For a simple visa, you can apply for the Canada Visit Visa. This
                visa lets you stay in Canada for up to 6 months. In Canada,
                single-entry and multiple-entry visas are the only two types of
                visas you can get to come to the country. If you hold a
                single-entry visa, you are limited to one visit to Canada.
                Allows its holder to come and go as often as they want while the
                visa is still valid. Everyone who wants a visitor visa can apply
                for a multiple-entry visa, and only a few single-entry visas are
                given out in scarce situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a person has a multiple-entry visitor visa, they can visit
                Canada as often as they want for six months as long as the visa
                is still valid.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following are the most critical aspects of this visa to keep

                A Visitor visa is required for the majority of tourists entering
                Canada. At the same time, some residents of countries require an
                Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) or who are exempt and can
                enter the country with their passports without a visa.

                A visiting visa to Canada takes between 8 and 40 days to
                process. Although the processing period varies depending on
                where you live, it is generally less than a week. As a result,
                you will have to wait approximately one month to process your
                Visitor Visa.

              </div>
              <p>
                The Canadian Consulate determines how long you will be granted a
                Tourist Visa for Canada on a case-by-case basis, depending on
                your circumstances. Depending on the circumstances, they may
                only give you a visa for the period you want to spend in Canada
                or grant you a visa until your passport's expiration. This
                outcome is entirely dependent on whether or not they feel you
                will return to your own country.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of how long your Canada Tourist Visa is valid, you
                are not permitted to remain in the country for more than six
                months at any given time. As a result, after six months, you
                must return to your home country, where you must remain for some
                time before returning to Canada for another six months.

                With the Canadian Tourist visa, you can visit Canada for less
                than six months as long as you have enough money. It is against
                the law for you to get Canadian documents or stay in the country
                long-term. It is also illegal for you to work or study, and you
                won't be able to get health care or other government benefits.

              <p>
                With a Tourist Visa, your spouse and children under 18 can come
                to Canada with you. However, they have to fill out their
                application, and each person has to pay their fees. As a family,
                you must submit all of your applications together at the Visa
                Application Center or online.

              <p>
                In contrast to a visiting visa, a visitor record is not tied to
                your passport like a visa is. It is a separate document that you
                will receive from the IRCC once approved your visa extension
                application.
              </p>
              <p>
                The visitor record contains information on the deadline by which
                you must depart Canada.
              </p>
              <p>
                Take note that a visitor record is only available while you are
                physically present within the borders of Canada. If you want to
                leave Canada and then return, you will not be allowed to
                re-enter the country if you have a visitor record.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your visitor visa is set to expire and you wish to leave
                Canada and return, you must apply for a new Visitor visa before
                going to the country.
