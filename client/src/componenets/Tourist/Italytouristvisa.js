                Many people go to Italy because it is in the middle of Italy's
                the Mediterranean Sea. As well as several castles- and
                palace-style buildings, the country boasts spectacular
                coastlines and breathtaking lakes as well as cliffs and gorges,
                making it one of the most attractive places on Earth. Get an
                Italy tourist visa for your favorite tourist destination and the

                An estimated 50 million people visit Italy each year from all
                over the world. As a result, some will have to apply for an
                Italy Tourist Visa before entering the country. A tourist visa
                for Italy is easily a Schengen visa with the sole aim of
                enabling the holder to visit the country for pleasure. Moreover,
                as a member of the Schengen Area, Italy's citizens do not
                require a visa to travel throughout the rest of Europe. A
                Schengen visa is probably necessary if you intend to visit
                Italy. However, if you have a valid Schengen tourist visa for
                Italy, you are free to visit any of the other Schengen countries
                during the validity of your visa.

                There are specific requirements for entering Italy on a tourist
                visa.

                  Depending on what type of Italy Schengen Visa you get, your

                  For such a Schengen visa, you cannot stay longer than 90 days

                and financial assistance is available at any time and

                event. In most cases, Schengen travel insurance covers
                everything from medical expenses to passport loss to personal
                accident coverage to medical evacuation to personal liability to
                trip delays to missed connection flights to the repatriation of

              <p>
                You could submit an application for an Italy tourist visa in one
                of the accompanying ways:
              </p>
              <ul className="points">

                  <span className="check-icon">✓</span>
                  At the absolute latest, two weeks prior to your scheduled
                  departure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span className="check-icon">✓</span>
                  It is advised that you begin planning your trip at least six
                  months in advance.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                But you should send in your Visa approval process early because
                it can take up to three weeks (15 working days) or longer to get
                an Italy visa, based on your nation and the details of your
                case.
