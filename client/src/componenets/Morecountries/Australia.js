                  must send in an online application through the Skill-Select
                  website. In this application, you will be questioned about
                  your talents and skills. Again, your answer will depend on the
                  visa subclass you are trying to get. You can apply for one of
                  three permanent residence visas if you are participating in
                  the Select Skill program.

                  The costs for advancing to higher levels are not the same. You

                  up all of these payments, including the fees for applying for
                  the visa.
