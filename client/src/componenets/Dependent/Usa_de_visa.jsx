                <h4>How can I obtain an American dependent visa from India?</h4>
                <p>In addition to its use as an employment visa, the H-4 nonimmigrant visa is also accepted as a dependent visa in the United States. The application process for this visa is identical to that of any other form of H visa. In order to make a request for a dependent visa in the United States, you would need to complete the following steps: </p>
                <ul className="points"><li><span className="check-icon">✓</span>Submit all necessary visa papers; </li>
                  <li><span className="check-icon">✓</span>Complete the electronic Form DS-160; </li>
                  <li><span className="check-icon">✓</span>Pay the H-4 Visa costs; </li>

                  <p>You will be awarded a visa based on the outcome of your application and interview. You can monitor the status of your application on the website of the U.S. Embassy where you have applied. This is done by inputting your application number.
                    The embassy will notify you after your H-4 visa application has been processed. After receiving a visa, you must go through the visa stamping procedure. This will be the final step before arranging a trip to the United States of America.</p>
                  <div className="sub-title"><h3> L2 Visa USA</h3></div>
                  <p>Your spouse or parent has just been offered a position at one of the company's affiliates in the United States, and they'd like to move to the United States with you. L-1 visas can be applied for as a management or executive (L-1A) or a skilled professional (L-1 visa) (L-1B visa). It's time to stop stressing about whether you'll be able to join them. If you're the L-1 visa holder's spouse or an unmarried kid under the age of 21, you can join them on an L-2 visa as a dependent.</p>
                  A visa for dependents, the L-2 visa is just that. This visa is the same as the H-4 visa, which is for the children and spouses of people with H visas. You can study, work, open a bank account, drive, and open a driver's license in the United States with an L-2 dependents visa. You also have access to extra benefits while your visa is active.

This applies only to those travelling with the J-1 visa holder. Those who possess a J-2 visa are reliant on those who hold a J-1 visa. As a result, any changes to the J-1 status will likewise affect the status of the J-2 visa holder.</p>
                  <p>Since there are so many sorts of J-1 visas, each has its own unique J-2 visa requirements.

                  <p>In the House of Senates, two U.S. congressmen have introduced a bill that would provide H-4 visa holders the freedom to labor in the United States without permission. Many Indian women would benefit from this, and it would help alleviate the current labor shortage that is affecting American businesses.</p>
                  <p>H-4 visas allow spouses and children of H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, and H-3 visa holders to accompany their spouses and children to the United States. A large percentage of H-4 visa holders had previously worked for themselves or supported their families, making them excellent candidates for temporary work in the United States.</p>
                  <div className="sub-title"><h3> An H4 visa can work in USA</h3></div>
                  <p>The H4 visa is awarded as a dependent non-immigrant visa. The H4 visa is made accessible to H1 visa holders' spouses and children who choose to accompany them. With this visa category, the H4 visa holder can study, reside, and work in the United States.</p>
