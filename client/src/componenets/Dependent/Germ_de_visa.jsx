                <div className="sub-title fs-4">Do I require a visa to visit Germany for family reunion purposes?</div>
                <p>If you live in the European Economic Area, the European Union, or Switzerland, you don't need a family reunion visa to visit a family member or relative in Germany. People from outside the European Union and the European Economic Area, as well as people from the third world, will need a visa to visit Germany to visit family.</p>
                <div className="sub-title fs-4">My birthplace is India. Is a visa required to visit my partner (spouse) in Germany?</div>
                <p>Yes. To enter Germany to join a relative, partner, or spouse, you will need a German visa for family reunification. Your future residence permit will be issued by the German Alien's Authority (Ausländerbehörde). The permission will be good as long as a family member, spouse, or partner of the applicant lives in Germany.</p>
                <p>How much does a visa for a family reunion in Germany cost?</p>
                <p>You must pay a visa fee at the time of your interview if you want to be considered for a visa. Children under the age of 18 often pay 37,500 Euros for long-term family reunion visas (category D).</p>
                <p>You must pay the cost again if you wish to reapply for a German visa for family reunification. After spending the application fee, you will not be eligible for a refund if you decide to withdraw your application. Your visa application will also not be paid if it is declined.</p>
