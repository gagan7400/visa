                Mexico City is a city that is filled with architectural marvels,
                as well as the sun, the beach, and the sky. With jungles,
                volcanoes, deserts, and beautiful beaches with white sand and
                warm water, Mexico is a never-ending source of adventure and a
                place where you'll spend a lot of time outside. With its mix of
                beaches, spicy food, dense forests, busy markets, and much more,
                the city makes dreams and wishes come true. You may remain on
                dry ground, go paragliding, snorkel in the cold blue seas of the
                Pacific, or climb the dormant volcanic mountains; Mexico will
                not fail to impress you in any of these ways. December through
                April, which fall within Mexico's dry season and have almost no
                precipitation, are the most fantastic months to visit the
                country.

                  One must take notice of the specific kinds of entries that are
                  permissible. If the visa only allows for a single entrance,
                  the bearer is only permitted to enter and exit Mexico once.
                  However, if the visa allows for multiple entries, the holder
                  is permitted to enter and exit the nation several times.

                </div>
                <p>
                  The Mexican visa policy instructs that any international
                  tourist entering the country by land or air must possess a
                  valid FMM tourist card. All passengers may apply and pay for
                  this document online, regardless of whether they will be
                  flying to Mexico or crossing the country's land border.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The FMM Mexican tourist card may be acquired online by filling
                  out a simple electronic application form with basic personal
                  and passport information and information on the anticipated
                  length of stay in Mexico.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To successfully submit the FMM application, you must have a
                  valid passport, an email address, and a credit or debit card
                  to pay the FMM application fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the FMM has been completed, the authorized travel
                  document will be sent to the applicant's email address
                  supplied during the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A valid Mexican FMM tourist card is valid for 180 days once an
                  immigration stamp has been affixed to it (upon arrival in
                  Mexico).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a necessary condition for admission into Mexico, this
                  electronic entry document must be requested by tourists from
                  all nations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In any case, the Forma Migratoria Multiple (FMM) is not a
                  visa. To visit the nation, visa-required citizens of Mexico
                  must have both an authorized tourist card and a valid visa.
