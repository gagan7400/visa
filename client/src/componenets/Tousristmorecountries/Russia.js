                single entry, but you can visit multiple countries if you have a
                visa that allows for multiple entries.

                Yes. Indians require a visa to visit Russia. Visas to Russia may
                be acquired by Indian citizens at any Russian Embassy or
                Consulate. It is necessary to demonstrate that you are eligible
                for a visa by submitting the proper papers, including an
                Invitation to Russia, in order to receive a visa to enter Russia
                if you are a citizen of India. Depending on the objective of a
                visit, a Russian Visa for Indians may be private, tourist,
                business, or work-related.

                In Russia, unlike most countries where you will be deported if
                your visa expires, you must obtain an Exit Visa to depart.
                Foreign nationals are issued a Russia exit visa in two
                circumstances:

                  Get in contact with the embassy of your home country in Moscow
                  in order to get a visa for exiting Russia. It is possible that
                  obtaining a visa in time for travel might take up to twenty
                  days.

                <div className="sub-title"><h3>Russia visa fees in Indian rupees</h3></div>
                <p>
                  Russia tourist visa fees vary based on various factors. Here
                  are some things to consider: Whether you apply for a visa on
                  your own, at a Russian embassy, or through a Russian travel
                  agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have a passport from India, you are eligible to submit
                  an application for an electronic visa to Russia. Since the
                  application is done online, you won't have to hire a travel
                  agency or fly to the nearest Russian embassy or consulate to
                  do it in person. Also, you won't have to make a hotel
                  reservation to get an invitation letter. This reduces the
                  costs of your visa application by a huge amount.

                  Numerous Indian applicants engage in an online service for
                  assistance with their applications. These ensure that the form
                  and associated materials are comprehensive and that no
                  submitted information is incomplete or incorrect.

                <div className="sub-title"><h3>Russia’s e visa</h3></div>
                <p>
                  Before flying to Russia, you must apply for a visa if you are
                  an Indian citizen without a diplomatic passport. Depending on
                  your circumstances, you could qualify for a variety of visas.

                <p>
                  The Russian eVisa is the simplest and quickest way to enter
                  the St. Petersburg-Leningrad region, the Kaliningrad Oblast,
                  and the Far East District if you are visiting Russia for a
                  short period for tourism purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Russian government only needs two to four days to approve
                  an eVisa. This implies that, even though you must apply a few
                  days in advance, you might begin to fret about your visa quite
                  close to your scheduled travel date. Applying for an India
                  eVisa takes only minutes.
