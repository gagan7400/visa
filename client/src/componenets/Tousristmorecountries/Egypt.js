              <h2>Egypt Tourist Visa For Indians</h2>
              <p clas="left-top-text">
                Travelers who meet the requirements must submit an application
                for an online tourist visa for Egypt and wait until they obtain
                approval before they may go to Egypt for tourism purposes.
                Travelers from seventy-five different nations, including the
                United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Germany,
                are now allowed to enter Egypt using an eVisa that has been
                pre-approved. This change took effect in 2017.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obtaining an eVisa for tourism may be done entirely online
                before departing for Egypt. This makes entering the country with
                pre-approved clearance simpler and safer. The tourist visa lets
                people from abroad come to Egypt to see places like the Pyramids
                of Giza, the Nile River, the beach resorts of Sharm el-Sheik,
                and the Valley of the Kings, or to go home to see their
                families.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, a person who enters Egypt on a tourist visa is not
                authorized to engage in any commercial activities or hunt for
                employment while they are in the country. Instead, it is
                strongly suggested that you can submit or contact the Egypt
                Tourist Visa agent for your application for an appropriate
                business visa or work visa.{" "}

              <p>
                When you apply for an Egypt tourist visa for Indian, you'll need
                a few things to back up your request, like:
              </p>

                <li><span className="check-icon">✓</span>
                  In addition to having three blank pages, your passport must be
                  valid for at least six months beyond the period of time during
                  which you will be staying.

                  Include a self-addressed, postage-paid envelope with your

                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Can I obtain an Egypt tourist visa online?</h3>
              <p>
                The Egyptian eVisa application and receipt are completed online.
                Before traveling to Egypt, travelers must apply for a tourist
                visa to be granted admission. To apply online for an eVisa,
                candidates must do the following steps:
              </p>
              <ul className="points">
                <li><span className="check-icon">✓</span> Enter individual information </li>
                <li><span className="check-icon">✓</span> Pay a transaction charge using a debit or credit card</li>
                <li><span className="check-icon">✓</span>
                  Provide a valid email address where the approved visa should
                  be sent
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Once the application has been submitted, there will be a
                seven-day processing time, after which the applicant will get an
                authorized eVisa through email. The visa must then be printed
                and presented with the passport supplied during the application
                procedure upon Arrival in Egypt.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the application procedure, information must be submitted
                from a valid passport in order to get an eVisa, which can then
                only be used in connection with that passport. If this document
                is replaced before entering Egypt, the previously issued visa
                will become invalid. To go to Egypt, you will need to provide a
                brand-new application in addition to your new passport.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Egyptian government also offers Visa on Arrival to tourists
                from the same 75 qualifying countries, which may be obtained at
                the traveler's entry point. However, this procedure might result
                in higher wait times at customs and immigration upon arrival. In
                addition to meeting the necessary conditions, visitors visiting
                Egypt risk being denied admission.

              </div>
              <p>
                People who are interested in travelling to Egypt may choose from
                two distinct visa options in order to enter the country. A
                single-entry visa for individuals who will only be visiting the
                Arab Republic of Egypt once, and a multiple-entry visa for those
                who will be visiting Egypt often over the course of many months.
              </p>
              <div className="sub-title"><h3>Tourist Visa with One Entry</h3></div>
              <p>
                The single-entry tourist visa allows visitors to Egypt a 30-day
                stay for tourism purposes. It is not possible to use the eVisa
                again once it has been used to pass through an Egyptian point of
                entry. It is necessary to get a second valid eVisa in order to
                re-enter Egypt.{" "}
              </p>
              <div className="sub-title"><h3>Multiple Tourist Entry Visa</h3></div>
              <p>
                The multiple-entry tourist visa for Egypt permits several border
                crossings during six months. This gives the foreign national a
                total stay of up to 30 days per entry throughout the duration of
                the visa's validity.
              </p>
              <div className="sub-title"><h3>
                How long is the duration of validity for an Egyptian visa that
                is intended for tourists?</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                A tourist visa for Egypt is valid for three months from the
                allocation date. If it is not used within this time frame, it
                will expire, and a new eVisa must be sought for, processed, and
                received to enter Egypt securely.
              </p>
              <p>
                If entering Egypt during this three-month timeframe, the visa
                will be valid for an additional thirty days from the day of
                entrance. However, the multiple-entry tourist visa allows visits
                of up to 30 days, which can be utilized six months after the
                original arrival.
              </p>
              <h4>Egypt visa on arrival for Indian</h4>
              <p>
                If you are qualified for an Egypt Visa Upon Arrival, you must
                get the visa after arriving in Egypt but before passing through
                immigration. The option to get a visa upon arrival in Egypt may
                be done so at any of the entrance ports' visa-issuing counters.
                The visa cost for Egypt must be paid in exact change.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, many tourists eligible for a Visa on Arrival opt to
                secure their Egypt visa before departure. All nationalities
                eligible for the VOA can also apply for an Egypt visa online,
                and the online approach offers greater security because you know
                your visa has been issued before making travel arrangements.

                  The processing period for an Egypt visa varies based on the

                <li><span className="check-icon">✓</span>
                  Because it takes about seven days to complete an Egypt e-Visa
                  application, it is highly advised that applicants submit their
                  forms at least seven days in advance of their travel date.

                <li><span className="check-icon">✓</span>
                  The processing period for applications submitted through an
                  embassy or consulate varies based on the individual office.
                  Don't wait any longer than three months before applying, since
                  it usually takes 10 business days in most cases.

                  Egypt Passport and Immigration Administration may be able to
                  extend your tourist visa (short-term visa) for an additional
                  90 days. You need to give a copy of both your passport and
                  your Egypt visa, in addition to the money for the processing
                  fee.
